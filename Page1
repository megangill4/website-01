## What is Quantum mechanics?
Quantum mechanics is the fundamental theory of nature which describes the  smallest scales and energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles. 

 - Quantum theories (including quantum mechanics and quantum field theory) are complete theories of our physical reality which have never failed since their discovery!  

 - Predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of accuracy.
